ARM:
electronic Gadgets like phone , microcontrillert..etc
ARM:
Before ARM introduce we have CICS
Cles ARM
load and store These & instructions only work in memory other instructions all work in Registers.

Secondary memory saves the saved codes.. when the code is send from secondary memory to primary.
=> For one set architecture neraiya microarchitecture inukum.
Arm is not a chip manufacturing company" design
Family can have multiple architecture for that can have multiple procusor.

ARM architecture specifier:
Multiple procellor
Instruction set
Register set
interrupt
Exception model

Debug, Trace and profilines

fioud point: 2.456 , 4.789

RISC- Reduced instruction set computer:
simple instructions
simple Addressing modes
Load store Architecture
Big Endian and little Endian
Mioro architecture
build and design of a processor
